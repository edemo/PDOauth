If you feel like you want to setup your own instance of PDOauth, then we are doing something wrong.
For testing, you don't have to install it; see README.testing.
If you want to provide SSO service for participatory democracy purposes, please understand the following:
The whole point of developing this software is to have one trusted single-sign-on service for
all who provide services to spread and improve the idea of Participatory Democracy.
This way we will have a common user base, so when the time comes to ask questions in a truly global level,
those who have enough credibility to do so will be able to do it with a small entry threshold for the people involved.

So before you start your own authentication/authorization service, please talk to us about your goals and/or concerns,
and we will do everything we can to alleviate them, and make it easy for you to just use this service.

Anyway, here is what we have done to install the software in our server.
- install an ubuntu server
- install all the packages mentioned in the debs_needed file
- check out the software from github (we do it to /usr/local/PDOauth):
  cd /usr/local ; git clone https://github.com/edemo/PDOauth.git
- install python dependencies:
  cd /usr/local/PDOauth; do sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
- set up a postgres database (actually you can use all major ones, we just happen to like postgres the best)
- create a facebook application for facebook login
- setup an ssl certificate for your CA, and another for your web site. We recommend to use different ones:
  for the site you most probably want a cert signed by a well-known CA, while you probably don't want to invest
  much money in the CA cert, which is just there because the trust model of X509 is sadly broken.
- create a config file. We use /etc/pdoauth/config.py for this. You can find an example for src/end2entests/config.py
- configure your apache. The important parts are found in end2endtest/apache2.conf
  One important thing is the wsgi python path. it should contain /usr/local/PDOauth/src, and /etc/pdoauth.

The URL to the hash anchor is wired in into static/script.js probably you want to install your own hash anchor and change it.

But again, please only install your own service if you have already tried to talk tuo us about your needs and we did not respond in
a cooperative way. (Which won't happen, ever.)
